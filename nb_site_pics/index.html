  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>At NB’s MarketSpace, healthy living isn’t new to me — it’s how I grew up. My father planted everything from caraillee and barbadine to callaloo bush and bodi, and every evening we picked our own mint, fever grass, or lime buds for tea. My mother always had fresh seasonings growing, so our kitchen was always full of real, wholesome food.</p>
  <p>Those simple moments shaped my love for whole foods and for knowing exactly where your food comes from. When my brother started selling produce, something lit up in me. One morning at 3 a.m. he took me to the market and showed me the ropes — and that’s how NB’s MarketSpace began.</p>
  <p>It’s plenty of work, but it brings me joy. I love helping people, supporting busy families, and serving my community. Whether you can’t make it to the market or just need an extra hand, I’m happy to make life a bit easier.</p>
  <p>And I’m not doing it alone — my children help with weighing and packing, and my husband is my steady support and encourager. There’s love and teamwork behind every bag.</p>
  <p>NB’s MarketSpace is more than produce — it’s family, care, and freshness delivered straight to your door.</p>
