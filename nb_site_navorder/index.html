  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p><em>NB’s MarketSpace was born from family traditions, early‑morning market runs, and a love for real, fresh food. Now, I’m bringing that same freshness and care to busy families across Couva and Roystonia.</em></p>
  <p>At NB’s MarketSpace, healthy living isn’t a trend — it’s how I grew up. Most of what we ate came straight from the land. My father planted everything he could: caraillee, barbadine, corn, callaloo bush and bodi. Every evening we would “pick” our tea — mint, fever grass, lime buds — and my mother always had fresh seasonings growing. Our kitchen was filled with the smell of real food.</p>
  <p>Those simple moments shaped me. I learned to appreciate whole foods and the comfort of knowing where your food comes from. So when my brother started selling produce, something in me lit up. One morning at 3 a.m., he picked me up in Couva and took me to the market. He showed me the ropes, and that’s how NB’s MarketSpace began — with excitement, purpose, and a lot of heart.</p>
  <p>This business is plenty of work, but it brings me joy. I love helping people. I love serving my community. And I believe in supporting busy families — whether you can’t make it to the market, or you just need an extra hand. If I can help you gain more time for your kids, for rest, or just for yourself, I’m happy to be there.</p>
  <p>And I don’t do it alone. My children pitch in — weighing, packing, helping design flyers and the website. My husband is my rock, encourager, and steady support. I’m grateful for the love and teamwork behind every bag I deliver.</p>
  <p>NB’s MarketSpace is more than produce. It’s family, community, and care you can feel. It’s the market delivered to your door — fresh, reliable, and personal.</p>
  <p>Welcome to NB’s MarketSpace — where freshness meets heart.</p>
