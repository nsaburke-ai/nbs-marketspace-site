    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        At NB’s MarketSpace, healthy living isn’t something I discovered later in life - it’s how I grew up.
        Much of what we ate came straight from the land. My father planted everything he could, from
        caraillee and barbadine to callaloo bush and bodi. We had a lot of fruit trees.  On evenings, we got to choose what we wanted for our tea -
        mint, fever grass, or lime buds, to name a few, and my mother always had fresh seasonings growing.
        So our kitchen was always filled with the smell of real, wholesome food!
      </p>

      <p>
        Those simple moments shaped my appreciation for fresh produce and the comfort of knowing exactly
        where your food comes from. When my brother started selling produce, something in me lit up.
        One morning at 3 a.m., he picked me up and took me to the market, showing me the ropes.
        That early-morning run sparked what would become NB’s MarketSpace.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ll admit this business is a lot of work, but it brings me genuine joy. I love helping people,
        supporting busy families, and serving my community. Whether you can’t make it to the market
        or simply need one less thing to worry about, I’m happy to make life a little easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m not doing this alone. My children help when they can, and my husband, as always,
        is my steady support and encourager! There’s care, teamwork, and intention behind every bag
        that leaves my hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        NB’s MarketSpace is more than produce - it’s freshness, reliability, and family,
        delivered straight to your door!
